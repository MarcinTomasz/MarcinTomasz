- 👋 Hi, I’m @MarcinTomasz
- 👀 I write python code because I need something to tire out my overactive mind.
- 🌱 I’m currently working through Automate the Boring Stuff, DataCamp courses and some projects.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on going over the AtBS assignments and Data Science courses.
- 📫 You can reach me on twitter @mt_malek
